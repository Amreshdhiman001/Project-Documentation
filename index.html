          What is C++ ?
        </header>
        <p>C++ is a general purpose programming language and widely used now a days for competitive programming. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features. C++
        runs on a lots of platform like Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac, etc
        </p>
        <p> Lets now look at the program:</p>
        <code>
          #include<iostream.h>
          <br>
          using namespace std;
          <br>
          int main()
          <br>
            {
              <br>
              cout <<"Hello World";
              <br>
              return 0;
              <br>
            }  
        </code>
        <br>
        <p>The main pillars of Object Oriented Programming are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Objects and Classes</li>
          <li>Inheritance</li>
          <li>Polymorphism</li>
          <li>Abstraction</li>
          <li>Encapsulation</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Object">
      <header>Objects and Classes</header>
      <p>Object-oriented programming. As the name suggests uses objects in programming. Object oriented programming aims to implement real world entities like inheritance, hiding, etc.</p>
    </section>

   <section class="main-section" id="Inheritance">
     <header>Inheritance</header>
     <p>
       The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called Inheritance. Inheritance is one of the most important feature of Object Oriented Programming.
       Sub Class: The class that inherits properties from another class is called subclass or Derived class.
       Super Class:The class whose properties are inherited by sub class is called Base or Super class. Using inheritance we have to write the functions only one time instead of three times as we
       inherited rest of the three classes from the base class(Vehicle).

   <section class="main-section" id="Polymorphism">
     <header>
       Polymorphism
     </header>
     <p>
       The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real life example of polymorphism
       is a person at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behaviour in different situations.

  <section class="main-section" id="Abstraction">
    <header>
      Abstraction
    </header>
    <p>
      Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important feature of object oriented programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data 
      abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world.
      Consider a real life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerators will increase the speed of car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know
      how on pressing accelerator the speed is actually increasing.

  <section class="main-section" id="Encapsulation">
    <header>
      Encapsulation
    </header>
    <p>
      In normal terms Encapsulation is defined as wrapping up of data and information under a single unit. In OOP encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and functions that manipulate
      them.Consider a real world example of encapsulation, in a company there are different sections like the accounts section, finance section, sales section etc. The finance section handles 
      all the financial transactions and keep records of all the data related to finance.
